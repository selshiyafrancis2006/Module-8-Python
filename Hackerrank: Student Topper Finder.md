## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program to calculate the final amount paid by Vimla for purchasing a microwave oven after applying a discount and adding CST.


## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program
2. Initialize the amount of the microwave oven as Rs.25,000.
3. Read the discount percentage (5%) and CST percentage (2%).
4. Calculate the discount amount:
         discount_amount=discount_percentage/100*amount
5. Calculate the CST amount:
         cst_amount=cst_percentage/100*amount
6. Calculate the final amount to be paid:
      final_amount=amount+cst_amount-discount_amount
7. Display the final amount.
8. Stop the program.

## 💻 PROGRAM:
```
amount=25000
discount_percentage=5
cst_percentage=2
discount_amount=(discount_percentage/100)*amount
cst_amount=(cst_percentage/100)*amount
final_amount=amount+cst_amount-discount_amount
print(final_amount)
```
